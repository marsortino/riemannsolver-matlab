Riemann Solver for a generic case, based on "Toro, Eleuterio F. "Numerical Methods for Fluid Dynamics: A Practical Introduction." (1999)."

This code has been written for a CFD course I took. It works for the case intended but it has some issues. Since I already passed the class, I do not plan to solve them.
